Eventually this should be a proper README file with instructions and documentation.
For now it is just project notes.

To do items:
* Should notes have a (recursive) node structure?
  o Specifically should Note extend Node?
* Separate node hierarchies for notes and categories?
* Add a categories property (or list?) for each note?
* Figure out proper annotations for classes and properties
